# About
I'm a vulnerability researcher that specialises in exploiting telecommunications systems, IoT equipment and embedded devices. However, owing to the sensitive nature of my work I've created this website to track my personal projects.

# Research
Someone wise once said --- never half-ass two things, whole-ass one thing. I take this to heart so focus my time on working within the arena of dynamic analysis. For anyone unsure of what I'm on about, it involves analysing binaries when they are running in memory --- emulated or otherwise. 

Some techologies I like to play with are:

* z3, CBMC, Manticore, Angr, KLEE
* Intel PIN, DynamoRIO, Frida, Panda
* AFL, libFuzzer, DrMemory, DrFuzz

# Projects
I'm also working on several projects and sometimes participate in capture the flag tournaments. I'm not particularly competitive in these events, but I like to make it harder for myself by finding new ways to solve the challenges.

If you're interested I try to post all of my work online including exploits, CVE's and CTF solutions.

# Speaking
On occasion I've been known to speak at universities and various cyber security events across the UK. So if you'd like me to talk about how a country might one day be destroyed via a cyber attack --- contact me using [jeffjerseycow@gmail.com](mailto:jeffjerseycow@gmail.com).
